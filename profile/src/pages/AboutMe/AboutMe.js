                    Being curious by nature and of analytical attitude, I developed my interest
                    in Mathematics and Physics since early childhood and pursued
                    engineering post-graduation as part of my education. I believe I have the
                    trait to experiment in doing things in a different way and I find it very
                    enriching to create something which is productively beneficial. Coupled
                    with my mathematics and engineering background, writing software code
                    attracted me as it creates a tangible output and has numerous
                    application which impacts our day-to-day life.
